            Calling back to the very first exercise we did in this class, the Hypertext assignment, I still see lots of implementations of these basic coding techniques towards the end of the semester, as much as the increased complexity of the entire artwork and possible turn-outs for combining different methods for the final display.

            For my final project, I choose to make a simple Gluttonous Snake game in p5.js, including a starter page, a skin-selection page, and a gaming page, taking in my digital drawings as the basic made-ups.

        <p style="color:rgb(66, 66, 66)">
            Looking at the entire semester as a whole, I guess the main reason for me to develop this game is to address the interactions that the Internet art can bring to the audiences, along with its characteristics on program-based and can be animated by creating and calling the functions.

            Visual display is another huge component of this semester, from the visual effects for html webpages to the parametric drawings in p5.js, we’ve always used the digital methods as the tool to visualize our thoughts or demonstrate our styles.

            However, from the first website we created, which was simple texts with stable images, we now have the ability to do whatever is in our mind by thinking logically and applying our understandings of Art to these strictly ran programs. </p>
